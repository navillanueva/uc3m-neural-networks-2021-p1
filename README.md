# Neural Networks Comparison

Project for Neural Networks course at Universidad Carlos 3 de Madrid in October of 2021. Programmed in python.

In this project we were handed a dataset with 1030 instances and 8 variables per instance( age and 7 materials) that described the composition of a type of concrete. With this we had to be able to predict the resistance that the concrete would have against a certain amount of pressure (MPa) according to its composition.

For doing this, two different models were created and tested. The first one is a linear model know as Adaline and the second one is a non-linear one known as Multilayer Perceptron. For each neural network we tested the different learning rates and cycles (Adaline) and also different number of hidden layers with the Multilayer Perceptron.

Disclaimer: unfortunately I no longer have access to the dataset and can´t upload it, so the code can´t be runned.
